## Vulnerability Overview

[REQUIRED -- Provide a general description of the finding type. This paragraph describes the type of finding, and *not* the specific instance that you found. For example, what is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, and not which instances of XSS did you discover. Introduce any key terms or information that would help the reader understand how their application is affected by it. Try to answer the questions “What is the problem?” and “How could an attacker exploit it?”]

### Finding Details

[REQUIRED -- Provide a high-level summary of the vulnerability finding that your team discovered. Include a vulnerability description for this specific instance, and which endpoints, parameters, functions or pages are affected.]

### Steps To Reproduce

[REQUIRED -- Provide a step by step on how to reproduce the vulnerability finding. Provide screenshots, curl commands, Burp Suite evidence, HTTP Requests and responses, or whatever you feel necessary to create thorough reproduction steps.]

## Recommendations

To address this finding, implement the following:
[REQUIRED -- Provide a high-level recommendation for remediating the vulnerability finding, giving the customer some topics for further research, rather than specific lines of code to change. Write the recommendation in imperative (command) form, in a bulleted list with bolded head words. For example: - **Patch Management**: Implement a patch management process to ensure that software components remain up-to-date.]

  [Optional - Provide any useful references related to the vulnerability you found, such as links to vulnerability blogs or details, CWE, CVEs, and exploits PoC, OWASP cheat sheets, or other resources)]

## Impacts

If not addressed, this finding could lead to the following:
[REQUIRED - Provide 1-3 bullet points describing what could happen for this specific vulnerability if not addressed. Write about what a hypothetical attacker could do, and use a bolded head word similar to the Recommendation format. For example: - **Unpatched Vulnerabilities**: An attacker could research and attempt to exploit any unpatched vulnerabilities.]
