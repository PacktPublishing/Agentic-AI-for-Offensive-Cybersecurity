# Brief Report Mode

## What Changed

AI is now instructed to generate **CONCISE** reports instead of lengthy ones.

## Length Guidelines

### Overview
- **Before**: Long paragraph explaining SQL injection
- **After**: 2-3 sentences max

### Findings
- **Before**: Detailed multi-paragraph analysis
- **After**: 2-3 sentences describing what was found

### Steps to Reproduce
- **Before**: 10+ detailed steps
- **After**: 4-6 brief steps (one sentence each)

### Recommendations
- **Before**: Long explanations for each recommendation
- **After**: 3-4 bullet points, max 20 words each
- Format: `- **Header**: One sentence`

### Impacts
- **Before**: Detailed impact scenarios
- **After**: 2-3 bullet points, max 20 words each
- Format: `- **Header**: One sentence`

## Example Brief Report

```markdown
## Vulnerability Overview

SQL Injection allows attackers to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code. This occurs when user input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL statements. The vulnerability can lead to unauthorized data access and system compromise.

### Finding Details

The login form at /login is vulnerable to SQL injection via the username parameter. Testing revealed that the payload ' OR 1=1-- successfully bypasses authentication. The application directly concatenates user input into SQL queries without parameterization.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Navigate to https://example.com/login
2. Enter ' OR 1=1-- in the username field
3. Enter any value in the password field
4. Click Login button
5. Observe successful authentication bypass

## Recommendations

To address this finding, implement the following:

- **Parameterized Queries**: Use prepared statements for all database operations
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs on the server side
- **Least Privilege**: Configure database accounts with minimal required permissions
- **Security Testing**: Implement regular penetration testing in CI/CD pipeline

- [OWASP: SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)
- [CWE-89: SQL Command Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

## Impacts

If not addressed, this finding could lead to the following:

- **Data Breach**: Attackers could extract sensitive database information
- **Authentication Bypass**: Unauthorized access to user accounts including admin
- **Data Manipulation**: Database records could be modified or deleted
```

## Key Changes in Code

1. **Tool Description**: Added "BE CONCISE AND BRIEF" warning
2. **Parameter Descriptions**: Added character/sentence limits
3. **Template Instructions**: Added "NO LONG PARAGRAPHS" warning
4. **Specific Limits**:
   - Overview: 2-3 sentences
   - Findings: 2-3 sentences
   - Steps: 4-6 steps (one sentence each)
   - Recommendations: 3-4 items (under 20 words each)
   - Impacts: 2-3 items (under 20 words each)

## Testing

After restarting Claude Desktop, reports should be significantly shorter while still maintaining professional quality and all necessary information.
